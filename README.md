# LiteNinja-EventBus
A Unity Event Bus for Unity.

What is an Event Bus? An event bus is a way to communicate between components of a game.
One of the issues I found by working with ScriptableObjects Events is that the number of events can easily explode.
So I decided to create a way to group events together.

## Usage
TBD
